# the idea is if you switch head, the possible difference between length would be countered.
# On the second traversal, they either hit or miss.
# if they meet, pa or pb would be the node we are looking for,
# if they didn't meet, they will hit the end at the same iteration, pa == pb == None, return either one of them is the same,None
